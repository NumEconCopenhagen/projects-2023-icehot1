# Data analysis project

Our project is titled **Intergenerational Mobility and share black** and is the effect of county share black on intergenerational mobility. We will investigate this effect by region in the U.S. Furthermore, we run a regression and look at the effect with and without including the share of children with single mothers. 

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [dataproject.ipynb](dataproject.ipynb).
The **code** for the regression can be seen from the py-file [inauguralproject.py]

We apply the **following datasets**:

1. Neighborhood Characteristics by Coounty.csv (*https://opportunityinsights.org/data/*) 
2. intergenerational mobility county copy.csv (*https://opportunityinsights.org/data/*)
3. cb_2018_us_county_500k.zip (*https://www.census.gov/geographies/mapping-files/time-series/geo/carto-boundary-file.html*)

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires the following installations:

``pip install geopandas``
``pip install plotly``
``pip install ipywidgets``
``pip install seaborn``
