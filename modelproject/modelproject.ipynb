    "Ramsey's model consists of households and firms where households maximize total present-day utility and firms maximize profits. In Ramsey's model, homes live forever, and this is complete foresight. The Ramsey model is often linked to the Solow model, but is simpler in the sense that it does not have to solve as many equations as is customary in Solow. We solve the Ramsey model by performing utility maximization, and for this we need to have the households' utility functions and their income bands, which we use to find the first-order condition. The utility function explains the aggregate utility of the household, while the income curve explains how capital stock changes between periods. We then set up a Lagrange function and end up with two differential equations – one for consumption (the Euler equation) and the other for the capital stock – that describe equilibrium."

    "The Ramsey-Cass-Koopmans (RCK) model, also known as the neoclassical growth model, is a dynamic optimization model that describes the behavior of an economy over time. It is an extension of the Solow-Swan growth model, incorporating optimizing behavior by households and firms. The RCK model is used to study the optimal allocation of resources between consumption and investment, the dynamics of capital accumulation, and the implications of various economic policies on long-run growth. The model's main components include the utility function, production function, and the consumer's optimization problem."
