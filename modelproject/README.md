# Model analysis project

Our project is titled **The Effect of Increased Public Consumption based on Ramsey's model** and is about how a shock on G on period one, that equalizes to 50% of GDP, affects many of the key variables in the economy. 

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [modelproject.ipynb](modelproject.ipynb).

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires no further packages.
